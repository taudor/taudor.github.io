Hi, I’m Tudor, a cryptography researcher at Fraunhofer AISEC in Berlin.

I’m interested in post-quantum-cryptography and the math behind it. Currently I’m working on efficient implementations and methods for post-quantum primitives, especially isogeny-based cryptography. Until March, I was a member of the Identity Management group located at the Freie Universität Berlin, where my focus was on Physical Unclonable Functions.
